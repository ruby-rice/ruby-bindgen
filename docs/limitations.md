# Known Limitations

This page summarizes current limitations and constraints in `ruby-bindgen`.

## General

- Correct parsing depends on accurate `clang`/`clang-cl` include and language arguments.
- Some libraries still require manual post-generation adjustments.

## C++ (Rice) Generation

- Generated code is not guaranteed to compile without manual fixes for all libraries.
- Default argument reconstruction is heuristic and can fail for complex C++ expressions.
- Some APIs need explicit skipping via `skip_symbols` to avoid compile/link failures.
- Functions/methods with unsupported signatures may be skipped (for example variadic callables).
- Methods returning pointers/references to incomplete types are skipped.
- Deprecated APIs are skipped.

## CMake Generation

- `format: CMake` is a second pass: it expects `*-rb.cpp` files already generated by `format: Rice`.
- If no Rice output exists in `output`, generated CMake source lists will be empty.

## FFI Generation

- Intended for C APIs. C++ class semantics are not represented in FFI output.
- Runtime loading depends on correct `library_names` / `library_versions` and system loader paths.

## Scope

`ruby-bindgen` optimizes for automating most wrapping work, then letting users handle edge cases via:

- configuration filters (`skip`, `skip_symbols`, `export_macros`)
- refinement files
- targeted manual updates for problematic generated code
